            <h1>Styling Hair is an Art Form</h1>
            <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Angel Clark and I have been in the business for over 35 years. Styles have come and gone just to return again. </p>
            <br />
            <p>With that being said I have a wide range of expertise. When I consult with you, I will listen to your concerns, look at the shape of your face and analyze exactly what your hair will do.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'm very dedicated to my work and want you to be pleased. I look forward to assisting you.</p>
